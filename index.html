         <h1>About Me:</h1>
          <p>My name is Vivian Braga and I am the creator of this website. If you spend enough time around here, youâ€™ll notice i have a sincere passion for writing, blogging and sharing my personal experiences. </p>
          <p>Born in the small town of Recife, Brazil in the year of 1995, I am a Journalism and International Relations student at University of Miami. Ever since a young age, my constant moving between South America, Africa and Europe allowed me develop a passion for writing about everything i learned.</p>
          <p>Today, at the age of 19, i have written for several magazines and publications, developed my own personal website, travelled to over 30 different countries and hopefully, will continue to share my experiences with you through this page. I hope you enjoy reading them just as much as i enjoy writing them for you.</p>
